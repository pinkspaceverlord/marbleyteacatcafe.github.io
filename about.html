                                <p>Our journey began in 2017 when people were so captivated with the cool beverages known as Milktea that they would buy it even if they were stressed out from work. Pets are the most valuable asset a person can have, and they have risen in popularity as a stress relief. Given the owners are pet lovers who enjoy sipping milk tea when we get together. We all agreed to establish a company based on our favorite beverage and pet breed.</p>
                                <p class="mb-0">
                                    Our business runs a vintage-themed pet café in North Avenue, corner Epifanio de los Santos Ave, Quezon City, 1100 Metro Manila. Marblelytea is the scientific name for it. We opted to call this marble in our firm after the phrase TEA, which stands for Milk Tea because it was known as Jolen and was played during the first generation of the 2000s in the Philippines. </p>
